# Contactform-Send-Copy
This script adds two things to the standard P&T contactform plugin:
* Sends a copy to the submitter that can be different then the original
* Sets the reply address for the admin to the submitter (which is not the standard)
* 

Installation: create a folder 'contactformsendcopy' and places these files  in that folder. upload and activate the plugin.

If you need to change the language, this should be done directly in the code (really not that hard)

This plugin comes with zero support. Still, I use it on a bunch of live sites. 

If you have any improvements, additions, I'd be happy to know :-)
