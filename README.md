# Contactform Send Copy For Craft CMS Contactform plugin 
This script adds a few things to the standard P&T contactform plugin:
* Sends a copy to the submitter that can be different then the original
* Allows separate reply addresses for the admin mail and the notification mail
* Sets the reply address for the admin to the submitter (which is not the standard)

Installation: create a folder 'contactformsendcopy' and place these files in that folder. Upload and activate the plugin.

If you need to change the language, this should be done directly in the code (really not that hard).

Although this plugin is used on several live sites and has had no issues, it comes with zero support. 

If you have any improvements, additions, I'd be happy to know :-)
